<p>Tumblr is not exactly a blogging platform. It is a microblogging platform with a social angle to it. As the name suggests, it is a tumblelog- a short-form blog. I can easily post text, pictures, videos, audios etc. And that completely serves my purpose of having a blog. Where tumblr really scores over wordpress is in the ease of use. I really love the tumblr UI. And in terms of user experience and user friendliness, tumblr is such a breeze. Beats all its competitors. And with social features like following a blog, reblogging, it is almost like twitter with no word limitations and an option to post pictures, videos etc. </p>
<p>Where wordpress scores is that it is open-source. You can do so much more with wordpress. And there is always a plug-in available in WordPress for anything you want to add. If someday I am writing a technical blog or a professional blog or something that requires more than just posting text and other media content, WordPress is a total winner by a huge margin over its competitors. Why? Because, I can manipulate my WordPress blog in just the way I want it . I can customize it into a content management system. I can edit and add PHP and HTML code in themes. I can virtually do anything with it. In fact,  WordPress is used by 13% of the world&rsquo;s 1,000,000 biggest websites. Including, TechCrunch and Mashable.</p>
<p>But, for a personal blog, tumblr is a winner for me. It is just so much more fun. And twitter has already proven that micro-blogging is much more successful than traditional blogging ever was. And Tumblr is the answer to the shortcomings of both Twitter and a traditional blog. It is like the missing link between blogging and micro-blogging. Tumblr is for people who want to post posts longer than a 140 characters tweet and shorter than a traditional blog post. Also it the best way to post media content. Serves my purpose perfectly.</p>
