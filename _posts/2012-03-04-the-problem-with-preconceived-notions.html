<p>Humans are the most superior living creatures on earth. They have this amazing ability of making opinions about people just by looking at them. The way you dress, the way you talk, the way you comb your hair, your CGPA,  and the place you come from is enough for people to make an opinion about you. Knowing the person is not a criteria here. We are humans. We are thinking creatures. We have intellect. As much as we try to not make opinions about people, we do. It comes naturally to us, it is instinctive. What are the chances that you are going to believe a person if he tells you that the world is not round, it is triangular? You are not even going to consider giving it a thought. </p>

<p>This is not a rant. This is about how I feel when I am judged by people based on opinions they form about me without even knowing me. Faces are misleading. Forgive me for stating the obvious, but different people are different. Some are introvert, some are extrovert. Some are shy, some are bold. Some are expressive, some are not. And you cannot infer these things without knowing them, you are not God. It is important to understand a person, before just stamping your judgement on them. Most people I know, are all good people. If I didn&rsquo;t try to know them, I would have never known how good they really are. I&rsquo;ve not had the best of opinions about some of my closest friends before I met them. But after knowing them better, all of that changed. What if, based on my preconceived notion about them, I had never tried to know them, I would then have never known how great they actually are. It was a really important lesson for me. So, give people a chance. Most people are good people. They will pleasantly surprise you, more often than not. Please don&rsquo;t let preconceived notion inside your head make you judge people. Have an open mind. Be amazed. </p>
