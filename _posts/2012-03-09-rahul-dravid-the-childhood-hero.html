<p><span>When you are a kid, you are always asked by older folks, who do you want to be like, when you grow up? For me, it was always Rahul Dravid. My childhood was at the time when Rahul Dravid was it his peak; he was averaging more than 70 in tests and averaging more than 100 in the ones we won. It was the time when I was just developing interest in cricket, and when you begin watching some sport, you always root for someone, that is how you develop interest in a sport. And for me, it wasn&rsquo;t the more obvious choice, Tendulkar, but it was Dravid. When I played cricket, I always tried to emulate his style of play. I could somehow relate to him.</span></p>
<p><span>As he retires today, it is really sad for me, because even now when I watch India play, I still root for him. He is the reason why I started watching cricket, and even after so long, he somehow, continues to be the reason. The joy of watching him play those beautiful square cuts, the cover drives, the straight drives, his batting in difficult pitches, the innings at Headingley,  Rawalpindi, Calcutta(was fortunate enough to see this match at the stadium), Adelaide, Hamilton and countless others, I am going to miss all that so much. Oh, he made childhood so much more awesome. </span></p>
<p><span>Rahul Dravid is a hero not only because he is such a great cricketer. There is so much to learn from him. When I said I wanted to be like him when I grew up, I wasn&rsquo;t talking about cricket. He may not be as talented and gifted as a Tendulkar or a Sehwag, but he has still done so well. He has proved that great talent is not the only way to achieve greatness. Not everyone is born with great talent, talent is luck. Whatever he has achieved, he has achieved it the hard way, without any shortcuts. And I am sure, if he had chosen any other career he would have been as successful. A role model in the true sense. </span></p>
<p><span>As a child, I tried to emulate his style of play in cricket. As I am older and much wiser now, I want to emulate his style of play in everything I do in life. And as far as cricket is concerned, I have to find someone new to root for. I am not sure I ever will.</span></p>
