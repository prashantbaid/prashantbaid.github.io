<p>Sixty days of summer. Sixty days of no college, no assignments, no studies. Sixty Days of learning and coding. What more can one ask for? :)</p>
<p>Since I am not doing any internship or any summer course, I have sixty days with me, and I can do anything I want to in these two months. Surely, not going to be lazying around. I won&rsquo;t get this huge amount of free time again. This is really the time to do something worthwhile. </p>
<p>I have an idea, sixty days, six app shipments challenge. Yes, not just app development, but app shipment, too. This means, I will have 10 days for each app, which should be enough time, for a small project. </p>
<p>Starting from 1st June, I will be writing one post everyday for sixty days, and will be posting about what I learnt that day, how much I moved ahead with the app, basically about the status of apps I will be working on.</p>
<p>Why write a blog post everyday? Sixty days, working on your own, you surely need some motivation. Writing a post everyday, will be an incentive to carry on with this challenge. </p>
<p>I am so excited about this huge summer project. Will be great to work with more people on this, so that I could finish apps as soon as possible. </p>
<p>So, who&rsquo;s in? </p>
<p>Maybe, I am being a little too optimistic here with six apps is sixty days, but, hey, I have nothing to lose, only to gain :)</p>
