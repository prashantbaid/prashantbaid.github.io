<p>I am two days late. But to be fair, I reached home just day before yesterday after a long 29 hours train journey. Also, I did not have a proper internet connection for the past two days.Â </p>
<p>After a lot of brainstorming for ideas, I am finally starting work on one of the ideas. Not a great idea, but the main reason for working on it is, I will get to learn so much!</p>
<p>What is the idea?</p>
<p>It is a very simple idea. Need to develop the idea more before I can write about it. It is going to be a mobile app. Will develop it for Android platform. I am a little confused on whether to use the JQuery Mobile Framework(along with PhoneGap) or the Android SDK, I might go with the latter, only because the app is mostly going to work offline. Although, JQuery Mobile Framework would have given me a great UI.</p>
<p>How long will it take?</p>
<p>Since I have never developed anything using Android SDK, although it is Java, it will take some time to learn and get used to it. I am hoping 10 days will be enough if I can put in about 10-15 hours everyday. So, by 13th June, I should be not just able to develop it, but also ship it.</p>
<p>With The Beatles playing in the background, let the coding begin :)</p>
