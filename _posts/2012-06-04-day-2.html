<p>Last day was not very productive. Downloaded Android SDK platforms for all the versions, was more than a GB in size and with my internet speed, it took me all night.</p>
<p>After the download was complete, setting up Android SDK was a real pain in the ass. Six months ago, I had so much trouble in setting it up in Windows, I thought Linux would be better, but it is as much pain as it was in Windows. </p>
<p>I chose command line(Ant) over Eclipse because I really wanted to learn about how to get things done in terminal, also my previous experience with Eclipse wasn&rsquo;t very pleasant. After some struggle with file permissions and sdk location problem, I finally ran the Hello World app.</p>
<p>After that, everything went very smoothly. Learnt about different layouts in Android. Developed a few basic things, getting used to the grammar and syntax before I start off with my application.</p>
<p>Learnt a thing or two about linux terminal also. The android code is still not completely understandable, but I have 8 more days. Hopefully, by then I will get my way with it.</p>
<p>Blocking Facebook from my system really improved my productivity, and to be honest, I did not get any urge to get back either. Twitter keeps me going when the going is tough.</p>
<p>I am reading from <a href="http://commonsware.com/books" target="_blank">these books</a>. You can get them for free from elsewhere on internet or from torrents.</p>
<p>Still the whole night is left, whole night of coding, learning and hacking. Must admit, getting the output is the best feeling in the world. All the hard work you put in, then you run the code, the few seconds of compiling and building, the tension and excitement, and finally when you see it running successfully, it is pure joy, much like sports.  </p>
<p>Oh summer vacation, I love you so much. :)</p>
