<p>It is 11:30 in the morning, I didn&rsquo;t sleep the whole night. But, I am not sleepy. I am happy. I just finished with my first app of this vacation. I know I had taken the sixty days, six app shipments challenge but I am just finished with my first app, and it is already thirty days. More on it later.</p>

<p>Few FAQs on the app now.</p>

<p><strong>Name of the app?</strong></p>

<p>600 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Screenshot?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is 600 seconds?</strong></p>

<p>Months ago, I had read an article which said writing everyday for a certain amount of time helps in clearing out your conscious thoughts and bring unconscious clutter to the surface. 600 Seconds app, does exactly that. Try writing as quickly as possible for 600 seconds. Don’t worry about what you are writing and don’t worry if you can read it afterward. Use the speed writing to loosen mental knots as the activity itself becomes a source of release. It really helps you clear your mind. Whenever you are feeling low, or you need to overcome the mental block, try this app. You are not supposed to think while writing, just write whatever that comes to your mind. And, don&rsquo;t read your posts immediately after writing. Read it after a week or so.</p>

<p><strong>How I made it?</strong></p>

<p>Phonegap + JQueryMobile + SQLiite.</p>

<p>Mostly everything is done in JavaScript, the backend is in SQLite. Even though PhoneGap is great, the apps built in PhoneGap still lack the finesse and the feel of a native app. Maybe, it is a little ahead of its time. I am sure, with faster CPUs and better frameworks, apps will get better. Same with JQueryMobile. It still feels like it is in beta, still a lot of issues with it.</p>

<p>Will be uploading the code very soon.</p>

<p>Obviously, there must be a lot of bugs in it. Let me know if you find any. Will try to fix it.</p>



<p><strong>What I learned?</strong></p>



<p>I actually learnt a lot of JavaScript. It is an amazing language. And, I am convinced, as we are moving towards a future with internet being the focal point of everything we do, JavaScript is going to be even more important.</p>



<p>Stackoverflow rocks! And I don&rsquo;t know how people developed apps before stackoverflow came into existence. If you are stuck anywhere while developing, there is a very high probability that there will be a solution to your problem in stackoverflow. And to folks who spend thousands of rupees in Android App Development workshops, try stackoverflow. You&rsquo;ll learn more. No better way to learn than try and error method!</p>



<p>Learnt a lot about Android App Development. It is not so difficult. Phonegap makes it very easy. It has good documentation and a great community of users too. Using web technologies feels like home. </p>


<p>This time a gave a lot of importance to good coding practices. Earlier used to get things done by writing ugly but working code, this time much better code.</p>


<p>There is a lot of difference between app development and app shipment. I finished with the most of the logical part of the app about a week ago, but finishing it requires a lot of effort, which is sometimes so annoying. I am happy this time I was able to finish the app.</p>


<p><strong>What Next?</strong></p>

<p>Already a month over and just one more left. I want to work with Python next. Expect more blog posts. :)</p>


<p><strong>Download link again? Okay.</strong></p>
