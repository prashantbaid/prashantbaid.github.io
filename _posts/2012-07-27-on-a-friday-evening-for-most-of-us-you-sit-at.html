<blockquote><p>On a Friday evening (for most of us), you sit at your computer, with up to three of your closest friends nearby, when suddenly your Twitter stream starts flooding! Your IRC windows start flashing by! Your friends start clicking rapidly on their own machines! “It’s up!” one of them yells.</p>

<p>You have forty-eight hours, up to three friends, a shared Git repository, a remote server, and Rails (or your favorite Rack-based framework). From that point on, it’s up to you - to design, develop, and deploy the greatest web application the world has ever seen!</p></blockquote>&#8212;Somewhere from internet. Have to do this very soon.
