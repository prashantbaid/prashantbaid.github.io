        <title>Girl With A Pearl Earring</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One day after I returned from work, I was browsing Reddit and Twitter as I usually do after coming back home. I saw a tweet of a painting. On other days I might have scrolled past it and moved on but on this occasion I found myself looking at this picture as if it had some spell on me. I could say it was because of the way her wide eyes looked at me, or the angle at which her face was turned, or her lips which were just slightly apart from each other and the earring she wore which was a distraction from her face, but in a pleasant way. Honestly, I don't know what it was. I was just curious. I wanted to know more about the painting, the girl in the painting and the painter. And thus began this journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;715&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;1023&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://65.media.tumblr.com/c8d8eb2cba247fc294dae65d43b13a54/tumblr_inline_ogjl9oVZXl1qdcryo_540.jpg&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;715&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;1023&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I searched, I found it is one of the most famous paintings of all time. It was the Girl With A Pearl Earring. I had no idea about it and I had never seen it before. It was painted by a Dutch painter called Johannes Vermeer. The painting is also called the Mona Lisa of the North because Vermeer was from Netherlands. But very little is known about the girl in the painting. Nobody knows who she was and what was her relationship with Vermeer. The identity of this girl still remains a mystery. My curiosity grew even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My curiosity led me to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_With_a_Pearl_Earring&quot;&gt;historical fiction novel&lt;/a&gt; about the story of this girl with a pearl earring written by Tracy Chevalier. I immediately downloaded the book and read it. I am so glad I came across this painting which led me to this book. It is a beautiful story of this beautiful girl written brilliantly in a simple to follow, addictive flow and it is hard to put it down once you start reading it. The author decides to name the girl Griet (what a lovely name!). The book is set in the seventeenth century Netherlands and it is easy to visualize the place and the Dutch society of the time because the author describes it so expertly. I felt like I was there in this little town of Delft, Netherlands with this girl as her story unfolds. The book is written in the first-person, from Griet's point of view. She works as a servant in Vermeer's house. The book also offers glimpses of the life of Johannes Vermeer. He only painted 39 paintings in his lifetime and would not paint more than a couple of paintings a year. The scenes between Griet and Vermeer, and especially her thoughts when she is around Vermeer are probably the best bits of the book. I remember a scene when Vermeer asks Griet what colour are those clouds and she confidently says, it's white. Then he explains how there is a bit of blue, a bit of yellow and some green in them and yet people say they are white. I looked out the window at the sky and I understood what he meant. I had never looked at the sky in that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I looked at the painting after reading the book, it appeared different to when I first saw it. It gave me a strange feeling, but in a good way. Now, the girl in the painting was a girl I knew. The face, the expression, the lips, the hat, the earring, it all looked so familiar now. Everything made sense. It felt like I was there when he painted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this time, I was not just curious, I was obsessed. I had changed both my mobile and laptop wallpapers to this painting. I found there was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335119/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;Oscar-nominated movie&lt;/a&gt; made on this novel. So, I downloaded the movie. Vermeer's character, to my delight, was played by Colin Firth who is one of my favourite actors. The role of Griet was played by Scarlett Johansson. At first, I wasn't convinced because the image of Griet in my mind was always of the girl in the painting. Also, because the kind of movies I had seen of her (The Avengers series, Don Jon, Lucy etc), I wasn't entirely sure she could pull it off. I was wrong. She was brilliant in the movie. Also, you may not agree with me on this but, I always love watching the movie after reading the book on which it is based. It always adds to the entire experience. I visualize the characters and the places in a certain way and it is fascinating to me to see how the director visualized it, irrespective of how different it was to my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;540&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;488&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/6ee349574a63f1859e04b046bb925765/tumblr_inline_ogjlhjfP161qdcryo_540.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;540&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;488&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later, I found there is a documentary called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089388/?ref_=nv_sr_1&quot;&gt;Tim's Vermeer&lt;/a&gt; in which an American inventor called Tim Jension tries to understand the painting techniques used by Vermeer and recreate one of his paintings as a &quot;science&quot; project. As you can see from the picture below, the details in his paintings are so realistic, like the lighting effect on the wall, the minute details on that table cloth, just like a photo. From this documentary I learned that Vermeer used some sort of optical device which projects a perfect image of one side of a room onto a surface equidistant on the other side - that surface was his painting canvas. It is a fascinating documentary, a lesson on art history and proper insights on the genius that Vermeer was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;902&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://67.media.tumblr.com/6440289906d47fa954da5beb3b5fe166/tumblr_inline_ogjlpbSMZn1qdcryo_540.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;902&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is weird how a tweet of a painting led from a simple google search to such curiosity and obsession. There is something magical about this painting, it still has some spell on me every time I look at it. I am so glad I came across this painting because I have learned so much because of it. Never tell me the odds because I could've easily been doing something else that day, I could've easily missed that tweet or if I wasn't in the mood, I could've just ignored the picture. It sounds silly, but I feel like I was somehow meant to go through this journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The painting resides in Mauritshuisan, an art museum in The Hague, Netherlands and it is one of the things on my bucket list to see the painting in the flesh before I kick the bucket. The other recent item in my bucket list is J.D Salinger's unpublished short story which I wrote about in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://prashantb.com/book-the-catcher-in-the-rye/&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Book - The Catcher in the Rye</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye?from_search=true&amp;amp;search_version=service&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/a&gt;, written by J.D. Salinger. I follow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/theSalinger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twitter handle&lt;/a&gt; that posts excerpts from J.D. Salinger’s works and that was a part of the reason why I wanted to read his works. So I started with the most famous of his works - The Catcher in the Rye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;640&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;946&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://36.media.tumblr.com/41437af41ee6a21acffdbfc894445769/tumblr_inline_o2wbu2pDH11qdcryo_540.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;640&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;946&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catcher in the Rye is a story about a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Written from his point of view, it is about a teenager’s angst, but truthfully, it is about a self-absorbed teenage punk who hates everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I read this book 10 years too late, but anyhow it was a very enjoyable read. Also, it is a very easy read. I read few chapters everyday in a bus when travelling to and from work.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caufield can be frustrating and annoying, and sometimes you just want him to shut up and grow up, but he is never boring and you are always hooked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could not relate with Holden Caulfield at all. But strangely this is why, for me, it was such an interesting book to read. What I liked the most about the book was its writing style. I felt like I was inside this teenager’s head, reading his exact thought processes, and you will get a feeling that the book was written by a real teenager, and that for me is a job well done by the author. I learned some cool phrases that American teenagers at the time used. For example, “&lt;i&gt;chew the fat&lt;/i&gt;” translates to “small-talk” and “&lt;i&gt;gave her the time&lt;/i&gt;” means “had sex with her”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a trivia buff and after exploring more about the author and the book, I found out that J.D. Salinger wrote a prequel called “The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls” but for whatever reasons, he withdrew the story before publication. Here is what Wikipedia says - &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was initially going to appear in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Bazaar&quot; title=&quot;Harper's Bazaar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but Salinger withdrew the story before publication. This story is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Library&quot; title=&quot;Princeton University Library&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Princeton University Library&lt;/a&gt;. Those who wish to read it must check in with two forms of identification with the librarian, and are then supervised while they read the story behind the closed doors of a special reading room. Per the terms of Salinger&amp;rsquo;s donation of the manuscript to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University&quot; title=&quot;Princeton University&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot be published until 50 years after his death; thus, the earliest it can be published is January 27, 2060. In November 2013, the manuscript of &amp;ldquo;The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls&amp;rdquo; was leaked to the general public, and made available online on the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What.cd&quot; title=&quot;What.cd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;what.cd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to hit the torrent and download the story. But, unlike Holden Caulfield, my better thoughts prevailed. I decided, out of respect for Salinger, whom I have grown to admire a lot, and the financial implications this leak may cause to his family, to wait until the story is officially published. If I am lucky to be alive, I will be 68 years old by then, and I hope the wait for this story will serve as a teeny-weeny motivation to look forward to life when I am having an existential crisis. However, the same courtesy was not extended to the movie -&lt;i&gt;The Revenant&lt;/i&gt; which I shamelessly downloaded when its torrent was leaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next book on my to-read list is Catch 22, another classic that I haven’t read. I have a feeling that 2016 is going to be the year of the classics :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. A random recommendation for a song I really like - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPvChNfplcY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gin Soaked Boy&lt;/a&gt;. (Random Trivia: This book has something to do with a line in this song) &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Web scraping websis portal to download the entire IT 7th semester data</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here is the final result in action: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prashantb.com/itdata/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://prashantb.com/itdata/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently scraped websis manipal portal and downloaded their entire data for 7th semester IT students. I used this amazing simple_html_dom PHP library to get data. Web scraping with this PHP library is very easy but the problem arises when there is a login page in the way of your data. How do you bypass the login page? The goal is to log in to the websis portal, download all their data and save it in your local machine. Getting data when you already know the log in credentials is not so tough as many have already made attendance status apps on that. But what if you want to log in without knowing the log in credentials? How do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you need web APIs when you can use the good old fashioned web scraping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I luckily had all the registration numbers of all IT 7th semester students. And it is not very difficult to get hold of that list (Hint: use Google). But the tough part is to get the corresponding birth date that is required to log in. There are two ways of doing this. Either you can contact all 7th Sem IT students and ask for their birth dates or you could run a simple loop. I know a few people who&amp;rsquo;d choose the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I noticed that most students in my batch were born in 1991 or 1992. So I ran a loop from 1st January 1991 to 31st December 1992 for each registration number and tried to log in in the websis portal each time. And when the combination of birth date and registration number was correct, I saved that combination in a database. Yes, this is not the most efficient way of doing this, but I had a lot of time and hey, it worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, lets get into some more details. There are 730 days between 1st January 1991 and 31st December 1992. And there are 160 students in IT 7th sem. So in the worst case scenario, where everyone was born on 31st December 1992, I will have to run the loop 730*160 times which is more than 1 lakh. So in the worst case, I need to request their webpage more than 1 lakh times to successfully obtain log in credentials of 160 students. That amount of requests in such a short span of time can cause a lot of server load and can even lead to crashing of the server. It took me more than 10 hours to download all the log in combinations successfully. Yes, it took more than 10 hours for the loop to terminate. As time went on, their server was responding slower and slower and even displayed 503 messages more than a couple of times. But, in the end, it worked. I had what I needed, and after that it was a cake walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had the login credentials of all the students, I easily downloaded all their data into my local machine. And it was very fast. Within 2-3 minutes, I had all the data of IT 7th sem students. It was like data porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had downloaded all the data, I did some interesting data analysis and produced some statistics from that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, web scraping without permission is a copyright infringement (Not the first time &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will be accusing me of that, though). Anyway, it was my duty to warn you and if you are still going to go ahead and scrap websis, do use a VPN to protect your IP. It will not take them much time to figure out who is trying to fuck with their website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prashantbaid/datam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to run pointclub website locally</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To set up pointclub locally, you first need the code in your local machine. So to save all your files locally&lt;span&gt;, you need to run the following command in your terminal-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SciDevs/pointclub.git&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/SciDevs/pointclub.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may take a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the files have been downloaded, you are all ready to go. But you need to work with the dev branch, so to change the branch from master to dev, run the following command-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;git checkout dev&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that you have the code, you need to configure your local server to run the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to first set up a virtual host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up a virtual host, you need to first edit your hosts file. If you are using linux it must be at location &lt;strong&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/strong&gt; and if you are using windows, then it must be located at &lt;strong&gt;c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open this file in a text editor and add the following line at the end-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;127.0.0.1 pointclub.local&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save the file. Now try to type &lt;em&gt;pointclub.local&lt;/em&gt; in your browser, it will show you the the same page as localhost. This name will be used to run pointclub website locally. You can choose any name you want to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After this, you need to tell apache that you will be using a virtual host. To do this, you need to edit the httpd.conf file located inside your apache folder. In linux, it is normally at this location &lt;strong&gt;/etc/hosts/apache&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;/httpd.conf&lt;/strong&gt;. If you using windows and wamp, it is at &lt;strong&gt;C:/wamp/bin/apache/Apache2.2.21/conf/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At around line number 467, under &amp;ldquo;# Virtual hosts&amp;rdquo;, uncomment (remove the hashtag [#]) the line &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save the file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now open up the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;httpd-vhosts.conf&lt;/strong&gt; file located at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;conf/extra/&lt;/strong&gt; of your apache folder in a text editor and add the following lines at the end-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ServerAdmin admin@localhost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    DocumentRoot &amp;ldquo;C:/wamp/www&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ServerName localhost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ServerAlias &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.localhost.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.localhost.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ErrorLog &amp;ldquo;logs/localhost-error.log&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    CustomLog &amp;ldquo;logs/localhost-access.log&amp;rdquo; common&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;br/ &amp;gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    DocumentRoot &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;project folder&amp;gt;\pointclub\public&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ServerName pointclub.local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;Directory &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;project folder&amp;gt;\pointclub\public&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;        AllowOverride All&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;        Order allow,deny&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;        Allow from all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t miss the line &lt;strong&gt;AllowOverride All&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, apache may ignore your &lt;em&gt;.htacess&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, restart your local server. If you have followed the above steps carefully, pointclub website must open in your browser when you type pointclub.local.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay, now that the code is up and running locally, you need to take a dump of the database located at phpmyadmin.pointclub.com. Log in to the website, select &lt;strong&gt;rewardly&lt;/strong&gt; database and click on export tab. And download the database. This may take a while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The database is around 40-50MB large and even after compressing it, it is around 8-10MB which is much more than the default 2MB import file size allowed in phpmyadmin. So to increase the size of import files, open &lt;strong&gt;php.ini&lt;/strong&gt; file. Locate &lt;strong&gt;upload_max_filesize&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;post_max_size&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;memory_limit&lt;/strong&gt; and change it to your desired values. Now import the database in your local phpmyadmin and you are done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now your code, virtual host and database is set up. Now open&lt;strong&gt; test.php&lt;/strong&gt; file located at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\pointclub\public\protected\config\ &lt;/strong&gt;and change the database username and password to your own username and password and then you will finally be able to run the code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>End of the most amazing semester of college</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://38.media.tumblr.com/635b9bd8593a5d4d682f2cb2a924f8ef/tumblr_inline_mn9r5wbF971qz4rgp.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, when I came to Manipal, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I really wanted to stay here. I am not very receptive to changes, especially when it comes to changes in the social environment. Unfortunately, social interaction is not my strongest quality. When it comes to building relationship with a person, it is a very long process for me, and I take a lot of time to reach that level where I can be comfortable around that person. So naturally, I am a little resistant to change, because I have to invest that time again on rebuilding relationships with new people. And it is a task I do not enjoy so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It will not be wrong to say that I am a little intimidated by meeting new people. I will not go as far as saying that I have social anxiety, but it is safe to say that I am shy, specially around new people. So when I came to Manipal, it was a cultural shock for me. I had never met so many different people. They came from different parts of the country, having different lifestyles, different upbringings, everything was so different from Calcutta, it was all too intimidating for me. Too many changes to process at the same time. My first thought, like every other human, was to run away. But, thankfully, better sense prevailed, and I stayed. And, in retrospect, I think that was one of the best decisions I ever took.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting so many different people, just observing them everyday, analyzing their behaviours, it helped me expand my mindset, and it changed my general outlook towards life. I learned to live on my own, there was so much freedom, you get exposed to so many new things, college is a great learning experience. The way they teach in college, the quality and the method, are both debatable. But college is a very important part of growing up. You go to college when you are in your late teens or early twenties. These are very important years of your life. Things you learn during these years, shapes your entire life. And when I say learn, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the academics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming to the title of this post- end of the most amazing semester of college till now. This has been the most amazing semester for me so far. I made a successful rip-off app, managed to get a legal panel set up against me because of that. Thanks to a senior, got an amazing internship at a start-up. Got surprisingly &lt;em&gt;lucky&lt;/em&gt; in the sessionals, despite the little effort I put in. Shifted out of the hostels, explored the town, went to some beautiful places. And, finally after five semesters, I finally think I was comfortable around my friends, and thankfully they are all great people. All the late night walks and hangouts, silly bollywood games we played, attending crazy parties, some amazing conversations with people, and other crazy stuff that is too crazy to reveal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will never forget the last four, four and a half months of my life. It really taught me a lot, and after a little introspection, i think it was that period of my life, where I finally took the plunge to unlock the next level of the game called LIFE.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I last blogged. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a manipal version of facemash. It got a few lakh hits, and in the end I had to shut it down because a legal panel had been set up against me. That was a crazy week. Building your product and destroying it in the same week, cannot get more thrilling than that. And in the same week, some fun adventures like trekking, exploring places in manipal, some deep conversations with friends, it was the most happening week of this semester. But all good things come to an end. Since that week, i&amp;rsquo;ve been brainstorming for ideas, and i&amp;rsquo;ve not found one yet. I have been sleeping all day. I miss waking up everyday in the morning with something to look forward to. When you are occupied with things you love doing, you are doing just fine. I need to find something to work on as soon as possible. This inactivity is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 am writings - I</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mctwp84J4g1qdcryo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever thought how it feels like when you want to write but you have nothing concrete going on in your mind and at the same time there are millions of things you are thinking, all simultaneously, disjointed yet mashed together, the summation of which is making no sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exams, three in the night and and an excellent breezy weather outside, the combination of the three makes for an excellent time to write, think, dream, procrastinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the zone now, when you get ideas, thoughts, that nice feeling that life is after all very beautiful, the one you create in your thoughts, where in spite of all the problems and tensions and sufferings, you are still happy. You feel there is still hope, there is still a chance that everything will be all right, and you want to cling on to that hope, because some where down inside you, you know everything will be just fine, eventually everything will fall into place, the puzzle will be solved, all the missing pieces will fit in. And then one day you wake up, it is all bright and sunny again, all your demons have vanished, your slate is clean again, no more fear, no more running away, no one to judge you, all your dreams are yours again, and with a smile on your face and a sense of accomplishment in your eyes, you just know it. you know you have made it. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
