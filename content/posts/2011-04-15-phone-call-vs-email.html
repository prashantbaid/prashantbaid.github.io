<p>I believe the conversations over email or messages is better than the traditional phone calls. Or maybe, it is because i am a socially awkward introvert. But i just feel the quality of conversations over emails is better because of the simple reason that you get more time to think before you type something. Therefore, you are able to express your views better. And there is always an option to press the backspace button. I think sometimes, to just maintain some social commitments like wishing birthdays, congratulatory notes, just dropping a hi etc, email is the best form of communication. I don&rsquo;t know if it is true for others or not, but for me, my thoughts have been more clearer when i have let my fingers do the talking instead of my mouth.Â </p>
