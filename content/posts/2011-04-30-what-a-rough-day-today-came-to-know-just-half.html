<p>What a rough day today. </p>
<p>Came to know just half an hour before a presentation that I am supposed to speak in that presentation. My biggest fear. Public speaking. And when I went there, stood up on the dice, i saw 80 students staring at me. I was unprepared. My heart pumped blood as fast as it could. And then I spoke. And what followed after that, I want to forget. And at the end of it, I felt I was standing there- naked. Avoided all eye contacts with my team members for letting them down and for a moment I felt like running away. But better sense prevailed, and I stood there hoping it was just a bad dream. I don&rsquo;t know if I can ever overcome my stage fear. </p>

<p>And to add insult to the injury, it was announced that I had an attendance shortage in that subject. And later on, my cell phone was confiscated for using it in the class. And with 36 hours of no sleep, I can safely conclude it was a very rough day.  </p>
