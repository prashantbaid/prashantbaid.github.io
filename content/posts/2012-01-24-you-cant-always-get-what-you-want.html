<p>You can&rsquo;t always get what you want. In fact, very seldom does everything go your way. Recently, I completed a web application. I was very optimistic about it. Worked really hard for it. Slogged for a lot of hours everyday. Woke up early on a Sunday, missed a brilliant Salim-Sulaiman concert. For what? To be told it can never be implemented. All the hours of hard work, all the hours spent on debugging, all in vain. Completely shattering. If I could go back in time, I would have probably watched a movie, gone out with friends, attended that concert too and would have slept till afternoon on Sunday, instead of working on that application.Â </p>

<p><strong>Lessons Learnt?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of lessons to learn here. As cliche as it sounds, you have no control over your life. You will not always get what you want. As the frustration of failure is settling down and sanity taking its place, I feel maybe I was too optimistic about this, maybe, there were a few things I could have done differently, maybe, it wasn&rsquo;t as good as I thought it was. Whatever it is, failure after hard work sucks ass. But, on the brighter side, I learnt so much while doing this project. I did so many things I at the beginning thought I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do. And I am really proud of it. But what sucks is, nobody is ever going to know. But as they say, life is not a bed of roses. You have to pick yourself up and move on. And move on I will. Hoping for a better luck the next time. They say failure makes you smarter. I hope they are right. They better be right.</p>
