<p>I have had a blog since 2006. My first blog was a very cheesy blogspot where I used to write about hacking and related stuff. It was really stupid. And ever since, I knew writng wasn&rsquo;t really my thing. I clearly don&rsquo;t have any talent in writing. My vocabulary stopped growing when I was five and grammar hasn&rsquo;t been very kind to me either. </p>
<p>I really wish I could write well, play with words, come up with clever phrases and lines. I wish I had a pool of words to choose from, everytime I wrote. I wish I could write poetry. </p>
<p>Writing is more important for me because, being an inherently introvert person, all my thoughts remain unsaid and need some outlet. I would any day prefer a piece of paper over a person to share my thoughts. Because, no matter how bad I write, it is no where even close to as bad as my speaking/socializing skills. Writing gives me that creative and personal satisfaction that I really need sometimes.</p>
<p>So often I get this great urge to express all my thoughts, but I can never find the right words to translate my thoughts. But, I try. I keep writing, keep reading, because if you are not talented, hard work is your last and only resort. As they say, if you keep doing what you love, and you do lots and lots of it, you inevitably get better at it. Maybe, i&rsquo;ll get better at writing too. I really want to. Because my thoughts have always been much more clearer when I have let the pen/keyboard do the talking for me instead of my mouth.</p>
