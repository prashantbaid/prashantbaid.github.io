<p>It has been a while since I last blogged. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a manipal version of facemash. It got a few lakh hits, and in the end I had to shut it down because a legal panel had been set up against me. That was a crazy week. Building your product and destroying it in the same week, cannot get more thrilling than that. And in the same week, some fun adventures like trekking, exploring places in manipal, some deep conversations with friends, it was the most happening week of this semester. But all good things come to an end. Since that week, i&rsquo;ve been brainstorming for ideas, and i&rsquo;ve not found one yet. I have been sleeping all day. I miss waking up everyday in the morning with something to look forward to. When you are occupied with things you love doing, you are doing just fine. I need to find something to work on as soon as possible. This inactivity is killing me.</p>
