One day as I was sitting on my bed, I had this absurd desire to draw circles on a sheet of paper using a compass and a sharpened pencil. I am usually not an impulsive person but on this occasion I was surprised at myself for feeling so strongly about doing this. 

I did not have a compass at home. I haven't had one since school. I remember not being very good at using compass. I would either press the hinge of the compass too firmly or too softly and the compass would invariably slip from my fingers, making a mess of my circle. It is often said that you can tell a lot about a person by the shoes they wear, does this stand true for circles they draw too? I hope not.

I went to a local stationary shop and bought myself a camlin geometry box. The packaging has changed a lot since I was in school. I much preferred the earlier design. They have retained orange as the primary colour, although it's a different shade of orange now. The box also feels sturdier. It cost me Rs 120 for this box. 

"New Fun Filled!" is written on the top right hand corner of the box in a comic font. I am excited now.

The inside of the box is beautiful. All the items are very neatly and precisely placed in their respective compartments. I do feel filled with fun! I don't want to take out the compass and break the symmetry!

I've been using a geometry box since primary school and I had no idea what this piece of instrument is called or what it does. I know it now. It is called a divider and it is used to measure distances. Still a bit unclear on how or when to use it. Not interested. All I want to do is draw some circles.

I drew a big circle with a diameter as big as the width of my notebook. On my first attempt. This felt good. 



I wanted to draw more circles. I wanted to fill the page with circles. I wanted to draw them to my heart's content. And that's what I did. I drew circles of all sizes, I overlapped a lot of them, I drew circles within one another. I drew them with no purpose or vision, I allowed my mind to do whatever it wished and this was oddly very satisfying. 

Here is the final result. You should try it too!
