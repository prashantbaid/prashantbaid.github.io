<p>Ever thought how it feels like when you want to write but you have nothing concrete going on in your mind and at the same time there are millions of things you are thinking, all simultaneously, disjointed yet mashed together, the summation of which is making no sense at all.</p>
<p>Exams, three in the night and and an excellent breezy weather outside, the combination of the three makes for an excellent time to write, think, dream, procrastinate.</p>
<p>In the zone now, when you get ideas, thoughts, that nice feeling that life is after all very beautiful, the one you create in your thoughts, where in spite of all the problems and tensions and sufferings, you are still happy. You feel there is still hope, there is still a chance that everything will be all right, and you want to cling on to that hope, because some where down inside you, you know everything will be just fine, eventually everything will fall into place, the puzzle will be solved, all the missing pieces will fit in. And then one day you wake up, it is all bright and sunny again, all your demons have vanished, your slate is clean again, no more fear, no more running away, no one to judge you, all your dreams are yours again, and with a smile on your face and a sense of accomplishment in your eyes, you just know it. you know you have made it. </p>
