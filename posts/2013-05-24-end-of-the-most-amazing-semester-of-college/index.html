<p>Three years ago, when I came to Manipal, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I really wanted to stay here. I am not very receptive to changes, especially when it comes to changes in the social environment. Unfortunately, social interaction is not my strongest quality. When it comes to building relationship with a person, it is a very long process for me, and I take a lot of time to reach that level where I can be comfortable around that person. So naturally, I am a little resistant to change, because I have to invest that time again on rebuilding relationships with new people. And it is a task I do not enjoy so much.</p>
<p><span>It will not be wrong to say that I am a little intimidated by meeting new people. I will not go as far as saying that I have social anxiety, but it is safe to say that I am shy, specially around new people. So when I came to Manipal, it was a cultural shock for me. I had never met so many different people. They came from different parts of the country, having different lifestyles, different upbringings, everything was so different from Calcutta, it was all too intimidating for me. Too many changes to process at the same time. My first thought, like every other human, was to run away. But, thankfully, better sense prevailed, and I stayed. And, in retrospect, I think that was one of the best decisions I ever took.  </span></p>
<p>Meeting so many different people, just observing them everyday, analyzing their behaviours, it helped me expand my mindset, and it changed my general outlook towards life. I learned to live on my own, there was so much freedom, you get exposed to so many new things, college is a great learning experience. The way they teach in college, the quality and the method, are both debatable. But college is a very important part of growing up. You go to college when you are in your late teens or early twenties. These are very important years of your life. Things you learn during these years, shapes your entire life. And when I say learn, I don&rsquo;t mean the academics.</p>
<p>Now coming to the title of this post- end of the most amazing semester of college till now. This has been the most amazing semester for me so far. I made a successful rip-off app, managed to get a legal panel set up against me because of that. Thanks to a senior, got an amazing internship at a start-up. Got surprisingly <em>lucky</em> in the sessionals, despite the little effort I put in. Shifted out of the hostels, explored the town, went to some beautiful places. And, finally after five semesters, I finally think I was comfortable around my friends, and thankfully they are all great people. All the late night walks and hangouts, silly bollywood games we played, attending crazy parties, some amazing conversations with people, and other crazy stuff that is too crazy to reveal here.</p>
<p><span>I will never forget the last four, four and a half months of my life. It really taught me a lot, and after a little introspection, i think it was that period of my life, where I finally took the plunge to unlock the next level of the game called LIFE.    </span></p>
