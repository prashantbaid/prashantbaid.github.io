Book - The Catcher in the Rye

<div class="section" id="title">Book - The Catcher in the Rye</div>

<div class="section" id="content">Sun Feb 21, 2016 &#183; 610 words

<div class="tag-container"><span class="tag"><a href="http://prashantb.com/tags/book">book</a></span><span class="tag"><a href="http://prashantb.com/tags/2016">2016</a></span></div><hr/>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service" target="_blank">The Catcher in the Rye</a>, written by J.D. Salinger. I follow a <a href="https://twitter.com/theSalinger" target="_blank">twitter handle</a> that posts excerpts from J.D. Salinger’s works and that was a part of the reason why I wanted to read his works. So I started with the most famous of his works - The Catcher in the Rye. </p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="946" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/41437af41ee6a21acffdbfc894445769/tumblr_inline_o2wbu2pDH11qdcryo_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="946"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>The Catcher in the Rye is a story about a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Written from his point of view, it is about a teenager’s angst, but truthfully, it is about a self-absorbed teenage punk who hates everything. </p><p>I know I read this book 10 years too late, but anyhow it was a very enjoyable read. Also, it is a very easy read. I read few chapters everyday in a bus when travelling to and from work.  </p><p>Caufield can be frustrating and annoying, and sometimes you just want him to shut up and grow up, but he is never boring and you are always hooked. </p><p>I could not relate with Holden Caulfield at all. But strangely this is why, for me, it was such an interesting book to read. What I liked the most about the book was its writing style. I felt like I was inside this teenager’s head, reading his exact thought processes, and you will get a feeling that the book was written by a real teenager, and that for me is a job well done by the author. I learned some cool phrases that American teenagers at the time used. For example, “<i>chew the fat</i>” translates to “small-talk” and “<i>gave her the time</i>” means “had sex with her”. </p><p>I am a trivia buff and after exploring more about the author and the book, I found out that J.D. Salinger wrote a prequel called “The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls” but for whatever reasons, he withdrew the story before publication. Here is what Wikipedia says - <br/></p><blockquote><p>The story was initially going to appear in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Bazaar" title="Harper's Bazaar" target="_blank">Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</a></i>, but Salinger withdrew the story before publication. This story is available in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University_Library" title="Princeton University Library" target="_blank">Princeton University Library</a>. Those who wish to read it must check in with two forms of identification with the librarian, and are then supervised while they read the story behind the closed doors of a special reading room. Per the terms of Salinger&rsquo;s donation of the manuscript to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>, it cannot be published until 50 years after his death; thus, the earliest it can be published is January 27, 2060. In November 2013, the manuscript of &ldquo;The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls&rdquo; was leaked to the general public, and made available online on the website <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What.cd" title="What.cd" target="_blank">what.cd</a>.<br/></p></blockquote><p>My first thought was to hit the torrent and download the story. But, unlike Holden Caulfield, my better thoughts prevailed. I decided, out of respect for Salinger, whom I have grown to admire a lot, and the financial implications this leak may cause to his family, to wait until the story is officially published. If I am lucky to be alive, I will be 68 years old by then, and I hope the wait for this story will serve as a teeny-weeny motivation to look forward to life when I am having an existential crisis. However, the same courtesy was not extended to the movie -<i>The Revenant</i> which I shamelessly downloaded when its torrent was leaked.</p><p>The next book on my to-read list is Catch 22, another classic that I haven’t read. I have a feeling that 2016 is going to be the year of the classics :)</p><p>P.S. A random recommendation for a song I really like - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPvChNfplcY" target="_blank">Gin Soaked Boy</a>. (Random Trivia: This book has something to do with a line in this song) </p>
