<p>One day after I returned from work, I was browsing Reddit and Twitter as I usually do after coming back home. I saw a tweet of a painting. On other days I might have scrolled past it and moved on but on this occasion I found myself looking at this picture as if it had some spell on me. I could say it was because of the way her wide eyes looked at me, or the angle at which her face was turned, or her lips which were just slightly apart from each other and the earring she wore which was a distraction from her face, but in a pleasant way. Honestly, I don't know what it was. I was just curious. I wanted to know more about the painting, the girl in the painting and the painter. And thus began this journey.</p><figure data-orig-width="715" data-orig-height="1023" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/c8d8eb2cba247fc294dae65d43b13a54/tumblr_inline_ogjl9oVZXl1qdcryo_540.jpg" data-orig-width="715" data-orig-height="1023"></figure><p><br>As I searched, I found it is one of the most famous paintings of all time. It was the Girl With A Pearl Earring. I had no idea about it and I had never seen it before. It was painted by a Dutch painter called Johannes Vermeer. The painting is also called the Mona Lisa of the North because Vermeer was from Netherlands. But very little is known about the girl in the painting. Nobody knows who she was and what was her relationship with Vermeer. The identity of this girl still remains a mystery. My curiosity grew even more.</p><p>My curiosity led me to a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_With_a_Pearl_Earring">historical fiction novel</a> about the story of this girl with a pearl earring written by Tracy Chevalier. I immediately downloaded the book and read it. I am so glad I came across this painting which led me to this book. It is a beautiful story of this beautiful girl written brilliantly in a simple to follow, addictive flow and it is hard to put it down once you start reading it. The author decides to name the girl Griet (what a lovely name!). The book is set in the seventeenth century Netherlands and it is easy to visualize the place and the Dutch society of the time because the author describes it so expertly. I felt like I was there in this little town of Delft, Netherlands with this girl as her story unfolds. The book is written in the first-person, from Griet's point of view. She works as a servant in Vermeer's house. The book also offers glimpses of the life of Johannes Vermeer. He only painted 39 paintings in his lifetime and would not paint more than a couple of paintings a year. The scenes between Griet and Vermeer, and especially her thoughts when she is around Vermeer are probably the best bits of the book. I remember a scene when Vermeer asks Griet what colour are those clouds and she confidently says, it's white. Then he explains how there is a bit of blue, a bit of yellow and some green in them and yet people say they are white. I looked out the window at the sky and I understood what he meant. I had never looked at the sky in that way.</p><p>When I looked at the painting after reading the book, it appeared different to when I first saw it. It gave me a strange feeling, but in a good way. Now, the girl in the painting was a girl I knew. The face, the expression, the lips, the hat, the earring, it all looked so familiar now. Everything made sense. It felt like I was there when he painted her.</p><p>By this time, I was not just curious, I was obsessed. I had changed both my mobile and laptop wallpapers to this painting. I found there was an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335119/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Oscar-nominated movie</a> made on this novel. So, I downloaded the movie. Vermeer's character, to my delight, was played by Colin Firth who is one of my favourite actors. The role of Griet was played by Scarlett Johansson. At first, I wasn't convinced because the image of Griet in my mind was always of the girl in the painting. Also, because the kind of movies I had seen of her (The Avengers series, Don Jon, Lucy etc), I wasn't entirely sure she could pull it off. I was wrong. She was brilliant in the movie. Also, you may not agree with me on this but, I always love watching the movie after reading the book on which it is based. It always adds to the entire experience. I visualize the characters and the places in a certain way and it is fascinating to me to see how the director visualized it, irrespective of how different it was to my imagination.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="540" data-orig-width="488"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/6ee349574a63f1859e04b046bb925765/tumblr_inline_ogjlhjfP161qdcryo_540.jpg" data-orig-height="540" data-orig-width="488"></figure><p><br>Later, I found there is a documentary called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089388/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Tim's Vermeer</a> in which an American inventor called Tim Jension tries to understand the painting techniques used by Vermeer and recreate one of his paintings as a "science" project. As you can see from the picture below, the details in his paintings are so realistic, like the lighting effect on the wall, the minute details on that table cloth, just like a photo. From this documentary I learned that Vermeer used some sort of optical device which projects a perfect image of one side of a room onto a surface equidistant on the other side - that surface was his painting canvas. It is a fascinating documentary, a lesson on art history and proper insights on the genius that Vermeer was.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="902" data-orig-width="800"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/6440289906d47fa954da5beb3b5fe166/tumblr_inline_ogjlpbSMZn1qdcryo_540.jpg" data-orig-height="902" data-orig-width="800"></figure><p><br>It is weird how a tweet of a painting led from a simple google search to such curiosity and obsession. There is something magical about this painting, it still has some spell on me every time I look at it. I am so glad I came across this painting because I have learned so much because of it. Never tell me the odds because I could've easily been doing something else that day, I could've easily missed that tweet or if I wasn't in the mood, I could've just ignored the picture. It sounds silly, but I feel like I was somehow meant to go through this journey.</p><p>The painting resides in Mauritshuisan, an art museum in The Hague, Netherlands and it is one of the things on my bucket list to see the painting in the flesh before I kick the bucket. The other recent item in my bucket list is J.D Salinger's unpublished short story which I wrote about in my <a href="http://prashantb.com/book-the-catcher-in-the-rye/">previous blog post</a>.<br><br></p><p><em>Update: I visited Hague in August, 2017 and got to see this painting in flesh at the stunning Mauritshuisan museum.</em> </p><p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BX-UkZ-gQ8w/" data-instgrm-version="8" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BX-UkZ-gQ8w/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">End of a story..
