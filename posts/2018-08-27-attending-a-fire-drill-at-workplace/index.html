<p>It was five minutes to three. I was going for lunch. I normally eat much earlier. But my manager was late for his lunch today. I always go for lunch after the manager returns back from his lunch. With this convenient arrangement, we both get to see each other&rsquo;s face less often.</p>

<p>The eating area was empty, there were only a couple of people in the room, both of whom were looking at their mobile screens, their thumbs positioned on the screen to make scrolling gestures. I chose a table in a corner and I kept my food in the microwave, soon the emergency alarm rang. Usually, the alarm is followed by an announcement that it is a false alarm. This time, the announcer asked us to evacuate the building immediately. The tone of her voice was very casual and this time the announcement did not end with her using the phrase &ldquo;DO NOT PANIC!&rdquo;, as she always does.</p>

<p>I waited for the microwave timer to complete, kept the food on the table and walked towards the stairs. In the back of my mind, I knew this has to be a drill. My suspicions were confirmed when I saw men in neon orange sleeveless jackets standing on every floor with their hands clasped behind their backs, smiling sheepishly at people passing by. There was also a man, wearing the same uniform, clicking pictures of us walking down the stairs with a real camera. This made me chuckle a little bit.</p>

<p>It was very hot outside and I was hungry. I have never attended a fire drill. I always sneak out. The crowd was building up in the designated safe assembly area. A short man with the same neon orange jacket and a black wayfarer sunglasses stood with a mic on a make-do podium. I looked around to see if I could find a familiar face, I could not find anyone, so I decided to stay and listen. Might as well learn a thing or two. The prospect of attending my first ever fire drill, oddly enough, got me a wee bit excited.</p>

<p>In spite of the best efforts of the speaker and his supporting crew to request people not to leave the gathering, a lot of people left the area, and some others were still figuring out ways to sneak out while they can. The lack of respect shown by some of these people towards the man on the podium vexed me a little bit.</p>

<p>Now there were only a few of us there, good riddance, I said to myself. I moved closer to the podium. The man looked even shorter from a close distance. He greeted us by saying good evening, even though it was just fifteen minutes past three. He started his speech by saying how unimpressed he was that it took us 13 minutes to evacuate the building. His voice was very shrill. He needed to hold his mic slightly lower from his mouth and the sound technician should&rsquo;ve reduced the volume by a couple of notches. Although, to his credit, he had a very confident voice and he spoke passionately. He switched from English to Hindi to Kannada very expertly, making sure everybody gets the message. He also inserted a few clever dad jokes in between that the crowd enjoyed. He must&rsquo;ve been doing this for a long time. I wondered if he used the same jokes every time because his delivery was flawless. He kept me engaged throughout. He taught a lot of useful techniques to help casualties on the event of a fire, which I hope I never have to use, but it is good to know. He also taught us how to use a fire extinguisher and invited a few volunteers to demonstrate. He told us stories of famous places in the past catching fire and spoke of the number of casualties in a very laid-back tone. I remembered this quote from Stalin I had read a long time back - one death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic.</p>

<p>The speech ended in about half an hour. He thanked us in the end and we all applauded the man as he stepped down from the podium removing his wayfarers. I must admit, there was a certain flamboyance about this man. The only thing missing was possibly a mic-drop. I decided to take the stairs instead of a lift to avoid the rush. I was out of breath by the time I reached my floor. I warmed the food again and ate my lunch.</p>
