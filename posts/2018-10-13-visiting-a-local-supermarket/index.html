<p>It was Sunday and I woke up early in the morning. I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. The mirror on top of my washbasin is a few inches below my eye level. I bent down a little to lean closer to the mirror. I could see my face in its entirety now. Due to the position of the light bulb just above the mirror and the sunlight from the window on the left-hand side, my face had a glow. What a wonderfully architected bathroom. I took a closer look at myself turning my head both ways. I noticed a colony of black spots at the center and sides of my nose. It was weird that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. I applied some face wash to cleanse my face. The black spots were still there, visible even more clearly now.</p>

<p>I opened my laptop and googled &ldquo;how to remove black spots from nose&rdquo;. I found out that applying an exfoliating scrub twice a week and using a rose water toner afterward can help remove blackheads.</p>

<p>I decided to go to my local supermarket. I enjoy wandering in grocery stores. The lighting in this one was very comforting. As I walked through the long aisles with products of colourful packaging stacked neatly against each other, I felt safe and guarded. There was an innocent optimism.</p>

<p>It was still early in the morning and there were only a few people in the store. A middle-aged man with a disproportionately big belly was holding an empty shopping basket and talking to a woman who appeared to be his missus. I could tell by the look on his face, he wasn&rsquo;t too chuffed to be here. I felt a t-shirt that is one size bigger would fit him better. A man of indeterminate age in slim-fit track pants was standing at the billing counter with only packets of two-minute noodles and a pet bottle of coca-cola in his basket - breakfast of champions.</p>

<p>As I looked for the personal grooming section, I put a jar of peanut butter in my basket. Of course, the crunchy one. In my experience, people who prefer creamy peanut butter over crunchy are not to be trusted in matters of opinion.</p>

<p>I saw packets of ready to eat frozen momos on the way. The picture in the packaging reminded me of the day I ate momos at a Tibetan restaurant years ago. I went there with a friend whom I haven&rsquo;t spoken to in years. We ordered pan fried momos. I don&rsquo;t remember what my friend was wearing or any of our conversations, even the face is very blurry in my mind but I recalled with absolute clarity, the image of those fried momos. The garnishing on top, the colour and the texture of the hot sauce - everything was so fresh in my memory. I could still taste the momos in my mouth. How selective my memory was that I clearly remembered how those momos looked and tasted and yet my friend&rsquo;s face was fading from my memory. The thought unsettled me. I decided not to buy them and moved ahead.</p>

<p>I now entered the potato chips aisle. Which packet of chips a person eats is my way of judging their character and this unprejudiced method has served me well over the years. There are people who will drink the most exquisite alcohol but accompany it with third-rate chips. Money can buy you the most expensive bottle of your favourite alcohol but choosing a packet of chips requires a vision, a scientific mind, years of trial-and-error, a philosophy even. I will go as far as saying - the difference between a good movie and a great movie is the choice of chips. I don&rsquo;t know how many more house parties do I have to attend before they forever ban serving plain salted chips.</p>

<p>I put a packet of chips in my basket and moved ahead. Finally, I was at the personal grooming section of this store. It was filled with rows of fairness and skin whitening creams. Some of the packagings were very upsetting. I found the exfoliating scrub that I wanted. Unfortunately, I could not find the toner. I also put an unflavoured lip balm in my basket and walked towards the billing section.</p>

<p>The man at the counter asked me if I will be paying by cash or card. I answered - card but my mouth failed to deliver the entire word and my pronunciation was all gibberish. I handed him my card and he proceeded with the billing. I cleared my throat which sounded like a timid whimper. I realized I hadn&rsquo;t spoken since answering the bus conductor where my stop was on my way back from work on Friday evening. The man handed me the receipt and I put the items in my bag which I brought from home. I doubled my spoken word count for the weekend by saying thank you to him. He did not reply and turned to the next customer asking her if she will be paying by cash or card. I carried my bag and exited the store.</p>
