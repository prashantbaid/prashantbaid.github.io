Drawing Circles

<hr/><p>One day as I was sitting on my bed, I had this absurd desire to draw circles on a sheet of paper using a compass and a sharpened pencil. I am usually not an impulsive person but on this occasion I was surprised at myself for feeling so strongly about doing this.</p>

<p>I did not have a compass at home. I haven&rsquo;t had one since school. I remember not being very good at using a compass. I would either press the hinge of the compass too firmly or too softly and the compass would invariably slip from my fingers, making a mess of my circle. It is often said that you can tell a lot about a person by the shoes they wear, does this stand true for circles they draw too? I hope not.</p>

<p>I went to a local stationery shop and bought myself a Camlin geometry box. The packaging has changed a lot since I was in school. I much preferred the earlier design. They have retained orange as the primary colour, although it&rsquo;s a different shade of orange now. The box also feels sturdier. It cost me Rs 120 for this box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New Fun Filled!&rdquo; is written on the top right-hand corner of the box in a comic font. I am excited now.</p>

<p>The inside of the box is beautiful. All the items are very neatly and precisely placed in their respective compartments. I do feel filled with fun! I don&rsquo;t want to take out the compass and break the symmetry!</p>

<p><img src="/images/divider.jpg" alt="Divider" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a geometry box since primary school and I had no idea what this piece of instrument is called or what it does. I know it now. It is called a divider and it is used to measure distances. Still a bit unclear on how or when to use it. Not interested. All I want to do is draw some circles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/circle.jpeg" alt="Circle" /></p>

<p>I drew a big circle with a diameter as big as the width of my notebook. On my first attempt. This felt good.</p>

<p>I wanted to draw more circles. I wanted to fill the page with circles. I wanted to draw them to my heart&rsquo;s content. And that&rsquo;s what I did. I drew circles of all sizes, I overlapped a lot of them, I drew circles within one another. I drew them with no purpose or vision, I allowed my mind to do whatever it wished and this was oddly very satisfying.</p>

<p>Here is the final result. You should try it too!</p>
