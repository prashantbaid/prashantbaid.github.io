      <description>One day after I returned from work, I was browsing Reddit and Twitter as I usually do after coming back home. I saw a tweet of a painting. On other days I might have scrolled past it and moved on but on this occasion I found myself looking at this picture as if it had some spell on me. I could say it was because of the way her wide eyes looked at me, or the angle at which her face was turned, or her lips which were just slightly apart from each other and the earring she wore which was a distraction from her face, but in a pleasant way.</description>

      <description>I recently read The Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. Salinger. I follow a twitter handle that posts excerpts from J.D. Salinger’s works and that was a part of the reason why I wanted to read his works. So I started with the most famous of his works - The Catcher in the Rye. 

The Catcher in the Rye is a story about a teenager named Holden Caulfield.</description>
