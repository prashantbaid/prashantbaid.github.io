      <description>It is 11:30 in the morning, I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep the whole night. But, I am not sleepy. I am happy. I just finished with my first app of this vacation. I know I had taken the sixty days, six app shipments challenge but I am just finished with my first app, and it is already thirty days. More on it later.
Few FAQs on the app now.
Name of the app?</description>

      <description>Last day was not very productive. Downloaded Android SDK platforms for all the versions, was more than a GB in size and with my internet speed, it took me all night.
After the download was complete, setting up Android SDK was a real pain in the ass. Six months ago, I had so much trouble in setting it up in Windows, I thought Linux would be better, but it is as much pain as it was in Windows.</description>

      <description>I am two days late. But to be fair, I reached home just day before yesterday after a long 29 hours train journey. Also, I did not have a proper internet connection for the past two days.Â After a lot of brainstorming for ideas, I am finally starting work on one of the ideas. Not a great idea, but the main reason for working on it is, I will get to learn so much!</description>

      <description>Sixty days of summer. Sixty days of no college, no assignments, no studies. Sixty Days of learning and coding. What more can one ask for? :)
Since I am not doing any internship or any summer course, I have sixty days with me, and I can do anything I want to in these two months. Surely, not going to be lazying around. I won&amp;rsquo;t get this huge amount of free time again.</description>
